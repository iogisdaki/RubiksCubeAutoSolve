# RubiksCubeAutoSolve
Animated Rubik's Cube solving itself using AI. It solves itself using the human beginner method. Meaning that, yes, the algorithm is hardcoded. 
The inspiration for this and the code for the animation is taken from Daniel Shiffman from TheCodingTrain.

<h3>Dependencies</h3>
You need to have processing obviously. More specifically if it throws an exception about OpenGL like it did for me, upgrade to processing 4 alpha 4 and above and it should be just fine.

<h5>Sidenote</h5>
I should note that there is one annoying thing. The way the cube is drawn the y axis is flipped so wherever it says y = 1 that means the bottom row of the cube and when it says y = -1 that means the top row of the cube. This is an old project that recently I decided to refactor a bit and I made quite a lot of changes. But I just can't bother with this lol sorry.  
  
 <h3>Preview</h3>
 Anyway here's a preview of the program:
